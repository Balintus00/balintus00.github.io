## Balint Traxler

I'm a software engineer based in Budapest, Hungary ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º and I'm working as an Android Developer.

### Experience

I hold an MSc degree in Computer Engineering, and I've been working as an Android Developer for
3 years.

### My current goal

I'm really interested in Kotlin based technologies, my current goal to master the language for
many different use cases (e.g. client development, backend development, data science) and platforms
(e.g. Android, Web, iOS, Desktop, different TV operating systems).
